# ScriptXApplicationSamples
A Visual Studio 2013/2015 Solution with projects illustrating the use of ScriptX (free and licensed) to print HTML content in .NET (WPF/XAML) C# desktop applications.

## WpfApplicationFreeUse ##
Illustrates using basic ScriptX capabilities (aka free) to print the content of the XAML WebBrowser element. 
This sample works on both Windows 7 and Windows 8/10 using the Internet Explorer Web Browser Control - in other words,
the installed Internet Explorer (IE 11). Of note is that the web browser control will default to emulating IE 7.
It isnt the purpose of this sample to show how to use the XAML WebBrowser element and how to resolve issues such as 
navigation and mode emulation. 

## WpfBrowserLicensedUse ##
This sample is the same as the free use sample but uses advanced features of ScriptX (setting the measurement units and [enhanced 
formatting headers / footers](http://scriptx.meadroid.com/knowledge-bank/technical-reference/enhancedformatting-factoryprintingenhancedformatting.aspx]). Advanced features are enabled by applying a MeadCo Application License.

## WpfDynamicHtml ##
