# ScriptXApplicationSamples
A Visual Studio 2015 Solution with projects illustrating the use of ScriptX (free and licensed) in various .NET (WPF/XAML) apps.

## WpfApplication ##
Illustrates using free ScriptX to print the content of the XAML WebBrowser element. This sample works on both Windows 7 and Windows 8/10 using the Internet Explorer Web Browser Control - in other words, the installed Internet Explorer (IE 11). Of note is that the web browser control will default to emulaing IE 7.
It isnt the purpose of this sample to show how to use the XAML WebBrowser element and how to resolve issues such as navigation and mode emulation.
